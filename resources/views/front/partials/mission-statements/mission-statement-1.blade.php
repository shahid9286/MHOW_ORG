                    <p>
                        House of Wisdom is a dedicated charity committed to making a real impact both locally and
                        globally. We go beyond physical welfare, focusing on the deeper challenges of mental health,
                        broken relationships, addiction, trauma, and spiritual unrest.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We provide comprehensive support through transformative workshops, healing retreats, and
                        educational programs that equip individuals with the skills to overcome life's trials and find
                        renewed purpose.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We envision a future where mental and spiritual well-being is a right, and those we support go
                        on to uplift others through empathy, wisdom, and shared strength.
                    </p>
