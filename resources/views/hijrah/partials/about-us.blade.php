                   Over 1,400+ years ago, the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ embarked on the blessed
                   journey of Hijrah — migrating from Makkah to Madinah. This historic event was not just a migration
                   but a turning point in Islamic history, marking the beginning of the Islamic calendar. The Hijrah
                   symbolizes sacrifice, faith, and trust in Allah, as the Prophet ﷺ and his companions left behind
                   their homes and endured hardships to preserve and spread the message of Islam.
                   <br><br>
                   The Prophet ﷺ and his closest companion, Abu Bakr (RA), sought refuge in the Cave of Thawr, relying
                   solely on Allah’s protection while enemies searched for them. With patience and steadfastness, they
                   crossed the harsh desert terrain, guided by faith and hope, until they reached Madinah — where they
                   were welcomed with love, unity, and devotion. It was here that the first Islamic society was built,
                   founded on justice, brotherhood, and service to humanity.
